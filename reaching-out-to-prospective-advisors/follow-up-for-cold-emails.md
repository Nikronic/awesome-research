By Sanya Jain

## No Response
As a first and the only reminder:

>Dear Dr/Prof X,
>I am sorry to interrupt your busy schedule; I was wondering if you got the chance to have a look at my email.
>Look forward to hearing from you.
>*signature*

Another sample[^1]:
>[!example] 
>Dear Prof. XYZ, 
>
>This is a kind reminder of the above email. 
>
>I would like to reiterate my intention of working with you as your research interests greatly align with my experience. 
>
>Thanks as I look forward to your reply. 
>Kind regards.

## Positive Response

1. Don’t make them wait for too long: You should ideally respond to them within the same day.
>[!success] Reply ASAP

>[!example]
>Thank you very much for writing back to me. If it's suitable for you, could we virtually meet next Tuesday, i.e. 29th September. The difference in our time zones allow my availability throughout Tuesday in Wisconsin.
>I look forward to hearing from you with your preferred time slot.

1. Simple encouragement for you to apply for the program: Gently ask them about their lab, recent research interests & what ideas are currently brewing in the lab via email so that you can mention those in your SoP.
>[!note]
>You can start this part by saying that you would like to name him in your SoP and further info about future research could be of help.

>[!example]
>I am writing to gain more information on the neuroimaging techniques employed by your lab to study the brain processes in the context of self-affirmations and social influence. As I was drafting my SOP, it would be extremely helpful for me to tailor the same with accurate information about the technology used in your lab. I am currently focusing my SOP on self- affirmations and socio-cultural moderators of persuasion.
>If you would like to update me on the changes or modifications that you foresee in your research, I would be glad to know that. Since I could not locate the lab website, I would also appreciate it if you could provide me with some insights into your research, that will help the focus of my statement of purpose as well.

3. In case the subsequent emails, ***ask them if they can connect you with any of the existing grad*** students: If they suggest you a set of students, you can ask them application tips that helped them get in. They can tell you the inside secrets of the lab/department and so on.
4. If they get ready for a video call: Try to ***fix the meeting*** within the next 1-2 weeks according to their time zone. And ask them if the times you proposed are convenient for them. Let them choose the time slots. Also, you should ***offer them to set up a meeting link*** so that you don’t burden the prof with additional tasks.
>[!success]
>Minimalize administrative tasks that a supervisors needs to do. Make your interactions in a way that they *point*, you *pave the way*.
5. Finally, after applying through the application form of the university, ***inform them that you have submitted your application*** and ***thank them*** for their support throughout your application process.
>[!example]
>I am writing to bring to your kind notice that I have completed my application for the PhD program in Mass Communications at the SJMC. I have elaborated some of the research directions we discussed over the skype call in my SOP.
>I would also like to thank you for your email explaining to me what you lab is currently doing, it helped me a lot. I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year in advance.
