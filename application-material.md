## Portfolio

> In your portfolio, you can include class and hobby projects alike, things you've done during internships, and, of course, research work. The portfolio should include, to the degree possible, pictures and videos (YouTube links are fine), as well as brief descriptions of what you did, what techniques you used and what major challenges you solved, what your role was in multi-person projects, and anything else that's relevant. For projects that have been written up in a paper, include links to the PDFs on arxiv or the final publication. Ask your artist friends for an example â€“ nothing happens in the art world without portfolios, and challenging technical work is no different in that grades tell only a partial story about your technical talent and creativity. I will unfortunately not be able to entertain requests that are not accompanied by such material. For an example of a good portfolio, see [here](https://users.aalto.fi/~lehtinj7/mikko-ronkainen-portfolio.pdf).  -- https://users.aalto.fi/~lehtinj7/adviceforstudents.html
