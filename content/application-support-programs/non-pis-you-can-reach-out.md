# Non PIs You Can Reach Out

Here, I've just created a table of the people, mostly students that have mentioned on their website that they'll try to answer questions. 

>[!warning]
>Please don't spam, and also ask relevant question to that person, they're not HR or admins. Don't abuse the honest and kind intention of people for little gain, and ruin the opportunity for those who truly need it.
