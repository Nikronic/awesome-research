Graduate Studies Application Assistance Program for Underrepresented Students in AI

>Chandar Research Lab is proud to announce the launch of its own assistance program for underrepresented students applying for AI graduate programs. This initiative aims to provide support for communities underrepresented in the field of Artificial Intelligence, in order to bridge the gap between studentsâ€™ access to guidance during the process of applying to high-profile graduate programs. We offer to pair students with established PhD and postdoctoral researchers from our lab and our academic/industrial collaborators who have volunteered to deliver meaningful one-to-one feedback on CV, application material and interview preparation.

>_Disclaimers:_
>
>- _This program is meant for students from communities underrepresented within the AI research community. Women and students from low income households are also encouraged to apply!_
>- _The information disclosed by candidates within this process will be kept strictly confidential to the program organization team. It will not be disclosed to any admissions committee, faculty or official entity. In particular, if you wish to apply to Mila, please note it will not impact in any way your recruitment process._
>- _With limited spots available, please be aware that the applicants will be selected on a first-come first-served basis._


>[!note] (my take) Note
>The form requires a few information:
>1. Why you think you are qualified for this (a short text box)
>2. Your CV
>3. Any other material you would like to be reviewed. So, it would be a better idea to prepare the SoP (at least an initial draft), so there is something to discuss.

(My take) The reason I applied is to help with my application for MILA or generally, Canadian schools including University of Montreal and Simon Fraser University.
