TODO:
- [ ] Create a table with each metric and their importance weight
- [ ] Create an entry for each school/supervisor that I get an interview

Consider important factors you think you care, e.g., city, group culture, etc. For each school give them a score between 1-10 and update it as you get to know the school more and more.

## The factors

| Factor                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | how to figure it out                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Advisor Personality**                   | This is the #1 thing you should be looking for. If your supervisor is not awesome, you will be miserable, and likely drop out or do a bad PhD.                                                                                                                    | - Talk to their students<br>- Talk to other students in their department who don’t work for that professor<br><br>=> infer it from lack of enthusiasm.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Advisor Enthusiasm**                    | A PhD is apprenticeship. As such, you want your advisor to be enthusiastic about taking you on, and they should absolutely be reaching out and encouraging you to join their group.<br><br>I do not recommend joining departments where you are just a head count | you should start a PhD only once you have an advisor lined up.<br><br>=> Email professors and only apply if they are pushing you to apply, not just suggest (like Alec Jacobson that didn't even show up and cost me $200). Someone like Cedric Zanni that was supportive and cared about my personal life too.          |
| **Advisor-Student Personality Match**[^1] | One needs constant attention, and other needs independent work and sometimes a bit of calibration.                                                                                                                                                                | Make sure you and your potential advisor are on the same page as to **how much time they can spare for you**.<br><br>=> Given I like independent work, I should see to that.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Research Group Culture**                | Collaborative or Independent?<br><br>warning: Every research group will claim to be collaborative;                                                                                                                                                                | - look for evidence based on shared authorship of papers,<br>- collaborative on-going projects<br>- whether the students seem to be friends with each other (versus merely tolerating each other)<br><br>=> Look for a group that everyone is interested in sharing ideas, even when there is no incentivization for it. |
| **Location**                              | The most productive PhD students I knew also had a healthy life outside the research lab. Your hobbies dictate your location. This will **contribute heavily to your happiness.**<br><br>See [[how-to-choose-your-grad-school#^dea8d4\|Variability]]<br>          | => Check the stereotypes of each city; the best metric of a society are the jokes around them.<br><br>=> I prefer small, rural cities with less illegal immigrants.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Weather**                               | Sunny? cloudy? rain? Don’t disregard the impact of weather!                                                                                                                                                                                                       | => I like sun but a lot of rain too. I can tolerate temps below 40 centigrade easily, but prefer 18-22.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
>[!success] Pick the HAPPY place
>I can talk about it for hours, but historically speaking, it is not a sound idea to spend best years of your life, getting frustrated to have fun later on. ***Journey must be intense yet enjoyable.***.


>[!note] **Coolness**; when in doubt!
>Pay attention to the grad students there. Are they cohesive? Honest with you? Happy overall? If programs are comparable, **pick the happy place.**
>
>How to know? if they are ***cool and honest*** with you.

>[!note] If you can't visit, ask questions from students
>You can email, previous or current student and ask them the same questions you would naturally ask if you were visiting the school.
>
>>[!warning] 
>> If they are *bothered* to answer your questions, there is a lot to say probably.
>
>> [!question]
>> - how the adviser responds when told about a failed experiment
>> - what do group member do in their spare time? do you go hiking, lunch, etc?
>> - does the advisor help with grant writing?

>[!note] Funding
>One way to compare is whether everyone is funded. If they are, there should be less competition over resources and they should be happier.

[^1]: Ask this as one of the questions for your interview. If they like independent work and how much time they would allocate.
