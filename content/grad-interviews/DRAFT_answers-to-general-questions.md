# Answers to General Questions

## For All Positions

>[!question] please shortly introduce yourself?

>Hi, I'm Nikan Doosti. I hold a master's degree in Computer Engineering specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I've spent the last two years as a Machine Learning Engineer, where I developed a data-driven decision-making solution that optimized resource allocation by giving high-potential customers a higher priority, hence decreasing personnel error by 10%. During my master's, I interned at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, where I researched physics-informed deep learning and physical simulation showcased in structural topology optimization, resulting in a publication in the ACM Symposium on Computational Fabrication. And in terms of technical skills, I use mostly Python and PyTorch, DVC and MLflow for data, model, and experiment management, FastAPI for web services, docker for deployment and whatever is necessary for solving the task in hand.

>[!question] Why do you wanna get a PhD?

>The goal of PhD for me is to solve a problem that **enough of people care about**, in a way that opens up new avenues in that particular research topic that we can build upon. Furthermore, I plan to **continue my career and a research engineer** and that's why I prefer the research style of theory with practice, and that is why I tend to consider research groups that include having a tangible result is in their priority.

>[!question] Can you tell us about a challenging situation you had at your previous work and how you handled it?

>During my research on ***scalability in computational fabrication, I developed an intuition that neural fields could achieve "super-resolution" or up-sampling behavior.*** However, my initial attempts to support this method in team meetings were met with skepticism, as I lacked reliable evidence to support my claims. Recognizing this, I took the initiative to independently design and execute experiments to validate my hypothesis. These experiments ultimately confirmed my intuition, demonstrating that neural fields could achieve up-sampling up to 20x without a surge in computational costs. This evidence persuaded my supervisors, who then actively supported further development and refinement of the proposed idea, leading to the addition of **Section 5.3** to our publication. This experience taught me the ***crucial importance of backing up claims with rigorous scientific evidence and the value of pursuing promising ideas.***
>
>For the second example, ***as AI Team Lead, I faced a challenge in advocating for communication and collaboration between different departments***, especially at one point, one-third of employees were new. To address this, I initiated monthly ***presentations on AI-related topics, accessible to a non-STEM audience***. These presentations served as a platform to showcase our team's work, explain key AI concepts in a relatable manner, and encourage interaction between team members from diverse backgrounds. This initiative improved communication across teams, increased visibility for our team's contributions, and even led to greater appreciation for AI's potential from the managers. This experience strengthened my communication and leadership skills and demonstrated the importance of ***taking initiative*** in building a cohesive team environment.

>[!question] What do you see doing in 5 years?

>[!note]
>You can start the first sentence by assuming you got the position.

>Within the next five years, I see myself making significant contributions to the field of ==FIELD NAME== through my PhD research at ==UNIVERSITY NAME==. I'm particularly excited about the likelihood of developing/working on ==RESEARCH QUESTION==.
>I aim to publish my research findings in top-tier venues and actively engage with the research community through presentations and collaborations. I'm particularly interested in the potential for interdisciplinary work in ==Other fields you think you can contribute to (e.g., robotics, human-computer interaction, and (medical and health applications) pharmaceutical and medical fabrication)==. While my long-term career goal is to become a research engineer in the industry, I'm open to exploring various opportunities, including postdoctoral research, depending on the trajectory of my research and the emerging landscape in the field. Ultimately, I'm committed to leveraging my PhD experience to address challenging research questions and contribute to the impactful advancement of AI in science and engineering, envisioning a type of work that is not only pushing the edges of science but also solving problems that create value for society directly.

>[!question] What do you bring to the table?

- **AI Specialization with Practical Experience**: Your background as an AI specialist with a focus on business decision-making and optimization gives you a strong foundation in applying AI to real-world problems. This ability to bridge theory and practice would be invaluable in research that seeks to generate innovative, applicable solutions.
- **T-Shaped Skill Set**: As someone who identifies as a T-shaped student, you offer both depth in AI research and a broad ability to tackle tasks beyond your specific field. This versatility means you can contribute not just to core research but also take on additional responsibilities such as handling technical implementations or exploring interdisciplinary applications, boosting the overall productivity of the group
- **Self-Driven and Quality-Oriented**: You have a proven track record of taking initiative, from optimizing a business to founding your own AI venture. Though the venture didn’t succeed, it highlights your entrepreneurial spirit and persistence. Your focus on maintaining quality and speed—preferring to handle tasks yourself when delegation adds unnecessary overhead—shows a high level of personal responsibility and commitment to delivering high-quality work.
- **Resilience and Problem-Solving**: Your experience with the challenges of launching your own product demonstrates your resilience in the face of setbacks and your problem-solving ability. You’ve faced unforeseen hurdles and adapted, which would be beneficial in a PhD environment where projects often take unexpected turns.
- **Communication Skills and Multidisciplinary Insight**: Through your experiences, you’ve developed the ability to communicate complex technical ideas in a way that’s accessible, which is essential for both collaborative work and disseminating research findings. Additionally, your ability to integrate insights from both business and AI could help the group approach problems from new, multidisciplinary perspectives.

>[!note] 
>This question can be field specific too. For instance, 
>- if the PI has industry experience, it is probably risky to claim expertise in it. Or,
>- if a PI prefers hands-on approach, you should not claiming that because you need to be spoon-fed is also means you want no one near you. I like hands-on depending on the situation (e.g., if I am new to a topic, and even early in my career.)
## Position-Specific Questions

>[!question] why you applied for this specific position?

^b02a82

You must raise specific scientific questions about the topic of interest

The goal is to show you share the same research questions (interests):
1. practically this is the expansion of the email you initially sent to say:
	1. why their lab
	2. what topic
2. if in your email you just showed your background can be a fit, you need to reiterate that
