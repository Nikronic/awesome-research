## Recommendation Letter Content

>[!success] Show what specific problem can you solve or what specific trait you have
>For instance, what skill you bring on the table in the prospective group.

The big questions for writing the recommendation letter can be as following:
- How are you related to the reference?
- What did you exactly do?
- What skills did you achieve?

>[!example]
>***How are you related to the reference?*** (First Paragraph) how long you have worked with each other, what courses you had, what skill you demonstrated (Soft: hardworking, or hard: deep understanding of topic X)
>***What did you exactly do?*** (Second Paragraph) Were you a TA, RA, or mentor, and what did you do? Did you create homework? grade them? etc.
>***What skills did you achieve?*** (Final Paragraph) Always pays attention to other group members and tries to help them even if their are not comfortable asking for it. Solves conflicts, teaches very effectively through proper presentation and demonstration, etc.

## Fitting

>[!success] what gap you can fill in a group

When preparing your *email*, *presentation*, etc., it is important to see what gap you can fill in that group. For instance:
- when a group doesn't have a post-doc, you need to do the mentoring and handling undergrad members. In this case you can show your previous TA experience, or managing junior employees at your previous job.
- Or when a group might colaborate with industry (as my focus), you can show your skills in doing end-to-end work, from research to deployment of AI solutions in practice to close the 2 year gap of research.

### Presentation

>[!success] Only and only stick to the key interest of the presentee

Only and only include topic and materials that are directly related to the interest of the professor you are applying to.

If the professor asked questions related to things you have done but not initially in the presentation, then you can expand in details. If didn't ask, just at max for one sentence mention that you have done things like that.

>[!danger] Saying too much is killer
>Even if you have worked hard on it but the professor never asked nor showed interest in any way of form. Saying too much just like Akhund, killer of a honest relation.

### Email

>[!success] Main focus of the email is the key interest of the professor, not your expertise

Same as the presentation, make the main focus of the mail, the interest of the professor you are applying. But include the other areas you have worked on.

For instance,
- If the professor was in AI, say that AI was not being used properly in engineering and you demonstrated that it could show the following benefits 
- If the professor was in engineering, say that engineering problems needed a novel solution, and by adopting AI you handled it.

## Application Fee

- In majority of cases, application fee can be waived.
- usually if the prospective professor liked your application, he/she would handle the application fee easily.
- In rare cases where the group is new or small, it might not happen.

## Finding Positions

Some websites:
- [ScholarshipDb](https://scholarshipdb.net/)
- [Academic Positions](https://academicpositions.com/)
- [PhD Portal](https://phdportal.com)
- [WASP group](https://wasp-sweden.org/) (for Sweden, mostly AI)
- [Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) - SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/)[^1]
- [GERiT](https://gerit.org) (for Germany, allows filtering all universities by degree and field)
- ~~emsiG.net (mostly for embedded systems)~~
- List of approved universities by ministry of science and education of Iran (check every 2-3 month the page of the universities for new positions). [Official website](https://grad.saorg.ir/portal/home/?272052/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C%D8%AF) and if it didn't work, use the [unofficial](https://raahjoo.com/approved-universities-ministry/) one.

On LinkedIn:
- Use the built in search
- Use the keywords you want like *scholarship*, *AI*, *PhD*, etc.
- Filter the result by *Posts* (not *People*)

Google:
- Googling the general titles, e.g.: Civil engineering university labs in Finland[^2]

[^1]: I just found in on a call on WASP group, and might not be even a fit all, but worth checking.
[^2]: For Germany, just use the [GERiT](https://gerit.org) website
