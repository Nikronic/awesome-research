## FAQs

>[!question] why are you copy pasting the materials

>[!success] Answer
> I did this considering the following reasons:
> 1. materials being removed/unorganized from the web 
> 2. I couldn't integrate my notes easily and update them in an iterative manner
> 3. I think my situation is unique and needs fine tuning of best advices
>
>To further elaborate each point:
>1. Some of the materials were just blogs and easy to copy, about 1/10 resources were removed the web and I retrieved them via web archive (some lost forever). On a separate note, some materials were only available as a video, X, comment in a forum, etc. I have integrated these stuff into the corresponding blogs or topics. So, you might find a page that there is no take from me, but might half the content have been gathered from different sources rather than just the blog. I believe this integration is worth rewriting.
>2. So, I have the issue of going deep in the rabbit hole in writing, i.e., spending half an hour just thinking of the header name. To fix this, I adopted Swiss Cheese style writing. But, for taking advices, this method means that you take the advice with barely adding anything to it, then you add gradually until someday most of the material is produced by me rather than the original author. Already, you can find some pages that almost all the parts are from the original author, yet find pages that a week ago (at the time of writing) were 100% from original author but now 90% is by me.
>3. I think my situation (things I have and things I want) is unique and wanted to create a self-help booklet, inspired by greatest minds, fine tuned with my experience, and hopefully a guideline for those who find themselves in my path
